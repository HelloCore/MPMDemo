Hello.

This is my demo project.
My previous employer had an internal website that every employee had to enter what they did in each day.
However, I found that I wasted a lot of time on that website, so I used my freetime making this application.

In this demo, you could easily double click on calendar to work detail, and that detail would be temporary detail until you hit save button.
You could save an information as a template by hit plus button in the left panel and use it later by dragging it to calendar.
You could simply duplicate an information by draging it at an icon on top-left panel in each information.

In addition, I developed a backend server that acted as a proxy server.
It parsed every request from this application, connected to the real server of my employer, and then converted responsed data to JSON format for this application.

Thank You.
